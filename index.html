        What and why
      </h2>
      <p>
        Have you ever tried defining yourself? Finding out who you are and what
        you love? Yeah, me too. Not once. Not twice. Probably more like a
        thousand times â€“ and still looking. So I thought I'll leave some traces
        here, in case any of those roads could be yours.

        THE List
      </h2>
      <div>
        <h3>Current obsessions</h3>
        <p>
          Short and not very descriptive list. But don't worry, all of those
          things will come back later on this page.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>practising Spanish!</li>
          <li>coding (obviously, we're here, duh)</li>
          <li>understanding music and rhythm</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Regularly starting and stopping</h3>
        <p>
          This section is about things I keep coming back to. I start them with
          enthusiasm, but then life happens, and I lose interest. It's a cycle
          of hope and disappointment. Also known as: my imposter syndrome list -
          things I deeply love and enjoy, but feel like a fraud admiting to
          consider them a hobby, as I'm not that good at any of them.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>writing (pretty obvious if you see the length of this page)</li>
          <li>learning Spanish</li>
          <li>learning Czech</li>
          <li>
            linguistics as a whole - why language? how language? what language?
            and other important and gramatically incorrect questions
          </li>
          <li>
            cycling - I have a bike. I love my bike. I ride my bike a lot, but
            then I see how many kilometers other people ride, and... then I hide
            my bike.
          </li>
          <li>
            music theory and general musical knowledge - it's so impressive! to
            hear something and be able to recognize instruments, tempo,
            patterns... And I want to be like those people I admire.
          </li>
          <li>
            Excel - yes, I know. What can I say, I love a good spreadsheet.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Yet to discover - someday, somehow</h3>
        <p>
          This could easily be my long postponed to do list. Or to try list. The
          fields listed below are the ones that always fascinated me, but I was
          too intimidated to try.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>coding</li>
          <li>
            djing - the best possible route to channel my music interest without
            any musical talent; aka forcing people to listen to the best curated
            tracks that I adore and being able to mix them smoothly and create
            atmosphere via music
          </li>
          <li>
            OSINT - inspired by Sofia Santos herself, I dream to one day join
            the Trace Labs search party
          </li>
          <li>
            drumming - always loved, never tried; please respect the drummers!
          </li>
          <li>
            scriptwriting - due to my event planning background, I've worked on
            some amateur film production plans as an organizational support, and
            might have thrown a couple of good ideas to the script. I'm also a
            master of creating and playing out the fake scenarios in my head, so
            who knows? Maybe it's talent hiding in plain sight?
          </li>

        <h3>Like Jesus on Easter: waiting for ressurection</h3>
        <p>
          Here lays a collection of dreams that have faded away, buried under
          the weight of time and reality. Follow me for a personal tour through
          the graveyard. Maybe one day they will rise again.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>guitar - because I was in high school</li>
          <li>
            ukulele - because I was in the university (and it's much easier to
            hide playing uku from your neighbours than playing a guitar)
          </li>
          <li>swimming (actually we could fit a whole sports section here)</li>
          <li>
            blogging - about language correctness, editing, and writing; about
            music and concerts; about books...

          <li>Turkish - yeah, I went on vacation once</li>

          <li>singing - but it turned out you have to have talent</li>

        <h3>Somebody that I used to know</h3>
        <p>
          Remember this kid that loved dancing? Or acting and directing plays at
          school? Let's catch up with her.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            dancing - ballroom and modern jazz. I spent most of my childhood
            taking dance classes and performing with my pair, my team, and solo.
            And then I've graduated primary school, our trainer moved to another
            school that was too expensive for me, and I've had some injuries in
            my joints. And everything ended.
          </li>
          <li>volleyball (both playing and watching)</li>
          <li>
            basketball (mostly watching, and mostly because of where I'm from ;)
          </li>
          <li>
            cheerleading - an obvious link between the three previous ones
          </li>
          <li>
            theatre: acting, but also directing plays (as it turned out I'm
            better at guiding talented people on the stage that being a talented
            person myself)
          </li>
          <li>
            journalism - that's what I studied, after all. Worked with some
            student media, papers, TV and radio stations, but I never had this
            THING that a journalist needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            writing (I used to write a lot, novels, poetry, journals with a
            stream of thought... mostly during the dark times)
          </li>
          <li>
            presenting - I've been the default go-to person to host school
            events, present group work at university, and speaking in public
            when needed during events at work. Funny, regarding how my first
            public appearance in school finished in crying and ruining the whole
            performance :D but I guess this one's making a little comback now?
            as I've been asked to host the next season of podcast at work...
          </li>
          <li>
            photography and photo editing - I mean, it's obvious, I've been to
            secondary school and had a photoblog. Just like everyone else at
            that time.
          </li>
          <li>
            copywriting - partialy a job, partialy a hobby, as I really enjoyed
            creating some cheesy marketing slogans for my clients, although the
            SEO product descriptions and articles were not that enjoyable
          </li>
          <li>
            event planning/management - beautiful and demanding, 6 years of my
            life. Left me completely exauted, mentally broken, and needing a
            1,5-2 months break before even thinking of staring a new job. Very
            fun, never again.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <div>
        <h3>Never ever in my life (unless I change my mind lol)</h3>
        <p>
          This section is reserved for things I know I will never do. Unless I
          change my mind, of course! We've seen it happen a couple of times,
          lol.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            cooking - you have to understand two things: sometimes I eat a piece
            of bread and a slice of ham seperately, because I don't want to
            waste time making a sandwich. And I eat very fast. The ammount of
            time needed for cooking versus the ammount of time spent on eating
            the cooked dish? Not affordable, better get some Uber.
          </li>
          <li>
            gym - you pay to go to a sweaty place in some building? to train
            with other people? no, thanks, I'd rather eat a rock
          </li>
          <li>
            running - why do you do it? is someone following you? feeling every
            part of your body jumping, sweating, losing breath... Just slown
            down and enjoy a walk, goddamn.
          </li>
          <li>
            starting my own business and dealing with entrepreneurship - okay,
            listen, I tend to get a little obsessed with my job, okay? So having
            a business that is your sole responsibility 24/7 is probably not a
            perfect match for my freak.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Never ever AGAIN in my life</h3>
        <p>Same as previous section, but this time I brought some proof.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>economy and stock market</li>
          <li>analytics and statistics</li>
          <li>
            scenography, architecture, home building and/or decorating - is it
            impressive? Yes. But I don't want to do it. Neither can.

        Pondering corner
      </h2>
      <p>
        All of those things make you wonder: why? How is that possible? What
        makes an individual so indecisive? There are a couple of things to
        consider here:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fear of failure - I hate not being the best at things when I start
          them
        </li>
        <li>Lack of time - allegedly, but I know I waste a lot of it</li>
        <li>Overwhelm from too many options</li>
        <li>Perfectionism</li>
        <li>
          Fear of judgment and SHAME - seriously, look up some Brene Brown stuff
          online, she changed my life in a way
        </li>
        <li>
          Imposter syndrome! Feeling not good enough in something to call it my
          "hobby" - that conects with SHAME, too. You know the famous question
          for people wearing a band's shirt? I feel that way toward myself and
          my interests: not knowledgable enough to be in the club. I remember
          meeting my ex's parents, and his father asking me: "Well, so what are
          your hobbies? What do you do?". I was so afraid of saying something
          that I'm not a master of and feeling judged by them later, than I
          choose to say "nothing" - as it was ever a better option.
        </li>
        <li>
          Boredom and routine. Things quickly lose their charm and become
          mundane. Activities that were once pursing my dream start feeling like
          an unpleasant chore after a week or two.
